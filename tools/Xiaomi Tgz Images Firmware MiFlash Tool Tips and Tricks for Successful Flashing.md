## Requirements
 
- A Windows PC with MiFlash Tool installed. You can download the latest version of MiFlash Tool from [here](https://www.xiaomiflash.com/).
- A Xiaomi device with an unlocked bootloader. You can check the status of your bootloader by going to Settings > About phone > MIUI version and tapping on it several times until you see a message saying "You are now a developer". Then go to Settings > Additional settings > Developer options and enable OEM unlocking and USB debugging.
- A USB cable to connect your device to your PC.
- A tgz images file for your device model. You can download the official firmware from [here](https://c.mi.com/oc/miuidownload/index) or a custom ROM from [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/c/xiaomi.483/). Make sure the file is compatible with your device and has a .tgz extension.

## Steps

1. Extract the tgz images file to a folder on your PC using a tool like 7-Zip or WinRAR.
2. Launch the MiFlash Tool on your PC and click on the "Select" button to browse and select the folder where you extracted the tgz images file.
3. Turn off your device and boot it into fastboot mode by holding the Volume Down and Power buttons together until you see the Mi Bunny logo.
4. Connect your device to your PC using the USB cable and wait for the MiFlash Tool to detect it. You should see a device ID in the tool window.
5. Click on the "Refresh" button to make sure your device is recognized by the tool.
6. Choose one of the three flashing options: "Clean all" to wipe all data and flash the firmware, "Save user data" to keep your data and flash the firmware, or "Clean all and lock" to wipe all data, flash the firmware, and relock the bootloader. We recommend choosing "Clean all" for a fresh installation or "Save user data" if you want to keep your data.
7. Click on the "Flash" button to start flashing the firmware on your device. Do not disconnect or interrupt the process until it is completed. You should see a green progress bar and a message saying "The operation completed successfully" when it is done.
8. Your device will reboot automatically after flashing. You can disconnect it from your PC and enjoy the new firmware on your device.

## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any errors or issues while flashing, here are some possible solutions:

- Make sure you have installed the correct drivers for your device on your PC. You can download them from [here](https://xiaomifirmwareupdater.com/xiaomi-usb-drivers/).
- Make sure you have downloaded the correct tgz images file for your device model and region. Do not flash a file that is meant for another device or variant.
- Make sure you have enough battery power on your device before flashing. Charge it to at least 50% before starting the process.
- Try using a different USB cable or port if you have connection issues.
- Try using a different version of MiFlash Tool if you have compatibility issues.
- If you get stuck in a bootloop or face any other problems after flashing, you can try performing a factory reset from recovery mode or reflashing the firmware again.
