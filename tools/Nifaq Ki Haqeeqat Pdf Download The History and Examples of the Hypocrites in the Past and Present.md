Nifaq (hypocrisy) is one of the major sins in Islam that can lead to eternal punishment in the hereafter. Allah says in the Quran: \"Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire - and never will you find for them a helper.\" (Quran 4:145) Nifaq is a disease of the heart that causes a person to conceal his or her disbelief or disobedience while outwardly showing faith and obedience. Nifaq is a form of lying and deception that harms oneself and others.
 
There are two types of nifaq: nifaq in belief and nifaq in action. Nifaq in belief is when a person denies or rejects any of the fundamental articles of faith, such as the oneness of Allah, the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him), the resurrection, the angels, the books, and the destiny. Nifaq in action is when a person performs acts of worship or obedience only to show off or gain worldly benefits, while his or her heart is devoid of sincerity and love for Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).
 
The causes of nifaq are many, such as ignorance, doubt, arrogance, envy, greed, fear, love of fame and wealth, and attachment to worldly life. The signs of nifaq are also many, such as lying, breaking promises, betraying trusts, abusing others, mocking religion, being lazy in worship, being harsh to believers and friendly to disbelievers, and being inconsistent in words and deeds. The consequences of nifaq are severe, such as losing Allah's guidance and protection, being deprived of His mercy and blessings, being exposed and humiliated in this world and the next, and being doomed to hellfire.
