Tragicomedia Mexicana 2 is the second volume of a trilogy by Jose Agustin, a renowned Mexican writer and cultural critic. The book covers the social, political, economic and cultural aspects of Mexico's history from 1970 to 1982, a period marked by authoritarianism, crisis, oil boom and bust, corruption, violence and cultural change. Agustin uses a witty and sarcastic style to expose the contradictions, absurdities and tragedies of Mexican reality, as well as the achievements and challenges of its people.
 
The book is divided into eight sections, each one focusing on a different topic or theme. The first section deals with the aftermath of the 1968 student movement and the repression of the government led by Luis Echeverria. The second section analyzes the conflict between the private sector and Echeverria's populist policies, as well as the role of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in imposing austerity measures. The third section explores the discovery of huge oil reserves in Mexico and the consequent economic boom and waste. The fourth section examines the political reform of Jose Lopez Portillo, who succeeded Echeverria in 1976, and his attempt to create a more democratic and pluralistic system. The fifth section describes the environmental degradation, pollution and health problems caused by the rapid urbanization and industrialization of Mexico. The sixth section exposes the rampant corruption, nepotism and cronyism that characterized Lopez Portillo's administration, especially in relation to his close friend Jorge Diaz Serrano, who was in charge of the state-owned oil company Pemex. The seventh section discusses the cultural revolution and counter-revolution that took place in Mexico during this period, with special attention to the literary, journalistic, theatrical, cinematic, feminist and gay movements. The eighth section narrates the economic collapse of 1982, when Mexico defaulted on its foreign debt and Lopez Portillo nationalized the banking system.
