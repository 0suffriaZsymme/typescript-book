## What's New in V-Ray Next 4.20.01 for SketchUp?
 
Some of the highlights of V-Ray Next 4.20.01 for SketchUp are:
 
- **V-Ray Scene Intelligence:** This feature automatically analyzes your 3D scene and optimizes some of the most common settings, such as exposure, white balance, dome light, and camera position. This saves you time and hassle, and ensures you get the best results possible.
- **Adaptive Dome Light:** This is a new type of environment lighting that uses an image-based approach to create realistic and accurate illumination. It is up to 7 times faster than the previous dome light, and works well with both interior and exterior scenes.
- **NVIDIA AI Denoiser:** This is a new option to remove noise from your renders using artificial intelligence. It works in real-time, so you can see clean updates as you work. It also preserves fine details and textures, unlike other denoising methods.
- **GPU Rendering:** The GPU renderer has been improved significantly, with over 200% speed increase and support for more features, such as fog, atmospheric effects, displacement, subsurface scattering, and more. You can also use multiple GPUs to render faster.
- **Scene Interaction Tool:** This is a new tool that lets you interactively adjust materials and light properties directly in the SketchUp viewport. You can select any object in your scene and see its V-Ray parameters in a panel. You can also use this tool to create lights and materials from scratch.
- **V-Ray Toolbar:** This is a new toolbar that gives you quick access to the most important V-Ray tools and settings. You can easily set up cameras, adjust render settings, manage scenes, and launch renders from this toolbar.
- **Asset Manager:** This is a new window that helps you find and organize your V-Ray assets, such as materials, textures, lights, geometries, etc. You can use a custom library that can be shared across different SketchUp projects. You can also import and export assets from other formats.
