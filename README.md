## What is TypeScript

TypeScript is an open-source strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It was originally designed by Anders Hejlsberg in 2012 and is currently developed and maintained by Microsoft.

TypeScript compiles to JavaScript and can be executed in any JavaScript engine (e.g. a browser or server Node.js).

TypeScript supports multiple programming paradigms as functional, generic, imperative, and object-oriented. TypeScript, it is neither an interpreted nor a compiled language.
